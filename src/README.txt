Getting Started
---------------

If you have Visual Studio 2012, then you should have SQL Server LocalDB in place and you won't need to change any connection strings. If you use a different SQL Server for development, modify the connection strings in the following files accordingly:

- TinyNH.DemoStore.Admin\web.config
- TinyNH.DemoStore.ProductImporter\app.config
- TinyNH.DemoStore.Tests\app.config
